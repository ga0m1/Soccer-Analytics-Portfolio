# Minghong Gao's Football Analytics Portfolio

## 📊 About Me

I am a first-year Master's student in Data Science at **UC San Diego**, driven by a deep-rooted passion for football. As a lifelong **Liverpool supporter** and an avid **Football Manager** player, I have always been fascinated by the stories hidden within the numbers of the beautiful game.

My goal is to bridge the gap between my academic training in data science and the tactical nuances of football. This repository serves as a collection of my personal projects where I apply statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization to uncover insights from match data. I believe that a data-informed approach is the future of football, and I am dedicated to being a part of that revolution.

## 🚀 Projects

Here you'll find a selection of projects I've worked on. Each project includes a link to the code and a detailed analysis in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Project 1: Analysis of Darwin Núñez's Shot Performance (2024/25 Season)

![Nunez Shot Map](path/to/your/nunez_shot_map.png)

* **Description:** This project analyzes the shooting patterns of Liverpool's striker, Darwin Núñez. By visualizing every shot taken in the Premier League, I compared his actual goal tally against his Expected Goals (xG) to objectively assess his finishing ability and identify his preferred shooting locations.
* **Skills Used:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `mplsoccer`, `StatsBomb API`

### Project 2: [Coming Soon] Tactical Analysis via Passing Networks

* **Description:** An exploration of team playing styles by visualizing passing networks from a selected match. This project aims to identify key playmakers and common passing lanes to understand a team's tactical structure.
* **Skills Used:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `mplsoccer`
